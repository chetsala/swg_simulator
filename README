# Saltwater Chlorine Generator Simulator
## Overview
This project simulates a saltwater chlorine generator using the Zybo Z7-20 FPGA board. The system includes an OLED display, seven-segment display, rotary encoder, and multiple buttons and LEDs to provide a comprehensive user interface for simulating the control and monitoring of a saltwater chlorine generator.

##Components
Zybo Z7-20 FPGA Board
Pmod OLEDrgb (JE Connector)
Pmod SSD: Seven-segment Display (JD and JC Connectors)
Pmod ENC Rotary Encoder (JB Connector)
RGB LED for water flow indication (LD5)
RGB LED for system status (LD6)
Button to add salt (Y16)
Switch for user input mode (D18)
Button to increase temperature (M15)
Button to increase salt PPM (M14)
Button to control pool pump (K19)

##Functionality
System Start-Up:

User inputs the pool size (in thousands of gallons).
Set initial values for salt (in ppm) and temperature.
User Input Mode:

Rotary Encoder: Navigate menus and change parameters.
Switch D18: Toggle between user input mode and normal mode.
Button M14: Change salt PPM.
Button M15: Change temperature.
Running Mode:

LD5: Green when water flow is on, Red when off.
LD6: Green for normal, Yellow for warning, Red for error, Flashing when remeasuring.
Button Y16: Adds 20 lbs of salt, triggers remeasurement.
Button K19: Turns the pool pump on or off.
Display:

Pmod SSD: Show current status or user inputs.
Pmod OLEDrgb: Show detailed status outputs and menus.

##VHDL Code Structure
Entity Declaration:
Defines the inputs and outputs for the FPGA board.
Architecture Body:
Includes the initialization for Pmods, LEDs, buttons, and switches.
Implements the user input handling for initial settings.
## Initialization Sequence
Pmod OLEDrgb:

Commands to turn off the display, set contrast, set segment re-map, set display start line, set normal display, and turn on the display.
Pmod SSD:

Commands to clear the display initially.
Pmod ENC:

Placeholder for the actual encoder setup code.
## XDC Constraint File
The XDC file maps the physical pins to the corresponding FPGA I/O ports.
